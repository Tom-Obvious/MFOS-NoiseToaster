# MFOS Noise Toaster


> ##### Forked from *[Sam Zeter](https://github.com/samzeter/noise-toaster)*

## Motivation

First project to get back to electronic and learn something new along the way.
This repository is for the documentation of my journey to a full functional analog synthesizer and will probably help other people too.

This is my first electronics project for a long time and I decided to build an __Music From Outher Space -__ __*Noise Toaster*__,  because of the great documentation and the book 'Make: Analog Synthesizers' by Ray Wilson.

## TODO

* [X] Bill Of Materials
* [ ] dokumentation of the case
	* [ ] boxes py case for laser cutter
	* [ ] alternative diy case
* [ ] dokumentation of the front panel
	* [X] classic front panel design
	* [ ] alternative front panel design
* [ ] files for the pcb
